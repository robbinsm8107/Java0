<h1>Scheduling Project Prototype</h1>
I have taken a course on Sophia.org in preparation to start my Computer Science Degree at Western Governor's University. This is a very simple final project that I have created within the Replit.com web browser Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Sophia.org
- Replit.com
- Java 

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 11 Operating System
- Replit.com (Web Browser IDE)

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>
- I went through the Sophia Introduction to Java Course to gain a high-level overview of basic programming steps and use cases.
<br>
- I watched a few example project videos from Youtube to gain a better understanding of use cases. 
<br>
- I wanted to find something relatively simple, but useful to daily life with the hopes to eventually expand this scheduling project into a website or application.
<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

This is the overall, raw Java code for this project. I have created comments throughout the code to better explain what I was trying to do and why certain decisions were made within the code.

I am not going to pretend that this code is something that is ground breaking or anything. This is a very simple project that I do not particularily like. I am really hoping to use this project and make alterations of the project to eventually include a Graphical User Interface, include some sort of Database option, and make it much more user friendly and easy. I would like to turn this code into an actual application eventually, with the hopes to base it off of Java to springboard into creating a working, Scheduling application for the computer and Android. I am very far from this sort of capability, but I like to keep these things in mind.

<h2>Software Testing / Quality Assurance </h2>

<p>
I tested this project the same way that I like to test all of my projects; by asking my little brother to try it out. My younger brother has no affiliation with the technolgoy industry and works at a grocery store. He plays video games but knows nothing about coding / programming. When I did a demonstration of the code, his first question was "Why are there zeroes?" This made me realize that the code started counting from 0 instead of 1, and his suggestion made the output much easier to read right from the start. His next suggestion was to make it more user-friendly becasue the only way to modify the inputs are through modifying the actual code itself. Another great point. Testing these things with my little brother is something I look forward to becasue he alwasy gives great feedback on issues that a user would make complaints about. Sometimes this perspective is good to have, and I really appreciate the time we spend.
